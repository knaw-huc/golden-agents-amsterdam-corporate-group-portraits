## Model

### Dates
We tried to convert all uncertain dates to valid ISO-8601 date spans. In case there was a 'ca.' notation, we interpreted this as an uncertainty range of Â±2 years. This helps us to (bulk) query the data in our datastore.
For example, a notation of `1505 ca.` is converted to a date span of `1503-01-01/1507-12-31` (earliest begin / latest end). Depending on the context of the date, this sometimes is written as `1503-01-01|1503-12-31/1507-01-01|1507-12-31` (earliest begin | latest begin / earliest end | latest end).

### Provenance
Only the CreativeWork and Person resources carry a `prov:wasDerivedFrom` property that refers to the row number of the original csv file.
